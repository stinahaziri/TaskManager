                <h3>WORK MANAGEMENT</h3>
                <h1>Optimizing Time Management for taskM 4 Day Work Week</h1>
                <hr>

                <h2>Prioritizing well-being for future success</h2>
                <p>The cornerstone of TaskM success is our team. When living a balanced life, you tend to be happier,
                    healthier and more productive. We want our team members to have the opportunity to enjoy life more
                    and it is no secret that one of the positive side effects to it, is higher motivation and
                    productivity at the workplace. In fact, workplaces that don’t contribute to wellness reduce levels
                    of productivity by 17.5%. It’s because we don’t believe there are quick fixes to improve mental
                    health and well-being. We want to be as proactive as possible, reduce turnover rates, and attract
                    the best talent. And we can achieve this by building solid well-being initiatives ahead of the
                    transition.
                </p>
                <h2>Measuring progress</h2>
                <p>In order to gauge the impact that the 4 day work week has on employee well-being, we need to
                    regularly measure our outputs. This will enable us to scope out areas that are performing
                    particularly well and those that need improvement.

                    We will measure our progress through: <br>

                    <b>Staff surveys </b>: Gathering regular feedback from employees via surveys on employee well-being
                    and what they think about current policies and initiatives (i.e., using TaskM Monthly Happiness
                    Survey to gauge sentiments). <br>

                    <b>People data </b>: Regularly analyzing the level of absences and turn-over rates – these are all
                    indicators of how effective our initiatives are and whether they are making a difference. <br>

                    <b> 1:1s</b>: Scheduling regular 1:1s with employees to get a better understanding of their
                    well-being and work happiness.
                </p><br>
                <h2>Preparing for challenges</h2>
                <p>Unlike some of our other focus areas, Well-being is a slightly more complex squad to monitor and
                    improve. While we can definitely bring in new initiatives to enhance employee well-being (encourage
                    walking meetings, taking regular breaks, increasing awareness about work ergonomics etc, ) – it’s up
                    to our team members to make the choices. By normalizing conversations around well-being and mental
                    health – alongside our new initiatives – we’re confident we’ll be able to transition into the 4 day
                    workweek smoothly and empower our employees to be the best version of themselves. </p>

                <h3>We will continue to share updates on the progress of our Well-being squad as we transition into a 4
                    day workweek. Read more on why TaskM has chosen to implement a 4 day work-week here.</h3>
